# Task Management App

## Project Description

This project is a simple Task Management Application built using **Angular 18**.
It allows users to manage their tasks by adding, editing, deleting, viewing, searching, and filtering tasks.
All task data is stored locally in the browser using **LocalStorage**, so no backend is required.

The application is built using a clean and scalable structure with Angular components, services, routing, and reactive forms.

## Features

* Display a list of tasks
* Add a new task
* Edit an existing task
* Delete a task
* View task details
* Search tasks by title
* Filter tasks by status and priority
* Store tasks using LocalStorage
* Support for **Arabic and English language toggle**

---

## Technologies Used

* Angular 18
* TypeScript
* Angular Routing
* Reactive Forms
* LocalStorage
* HTML & CSS

## Project Structure

The project follows a simple component-based structure:

* **Components**

## How It Works

Tasks are stored in the browser using **LocalStorage**.
The application uses an Angular service to handle all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

---

## Expected Routes

* `/tasks` → Display all tasks
* `/tasks/new` → Add new task
* `/tasks/edit/:id` → Edit task
* `/tasks/:id` → View task details

## Notes

This project was built as part of a technical task to demonstrate Angular fundamentals such as routing, services, reactive forms, and component-based architecture.
